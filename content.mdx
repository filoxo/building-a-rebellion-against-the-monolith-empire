# What are microfrontends?

<p className="text-center block text-xl">microfrontends are</p>

**Microservices patterns applied to frontend engineering**{.text-center .block .mb-4}

- loosely coupled services, highly cohesive code
- enables scalability
- fosters team autonomy

    single-spa got its start at a scrappy startup (of rebels) named Canopy. It
    was born out of Canopy's desire to use React + react-router instead of being
    forever stuck with AngularJS + ui-router application. single-spa is now a
    mature library that enables microfrontends.

  So let's go back to a monolith. Have you ever worked on a codebase that had
  parts of it owned by others? For example, Team X owns the left nav. Due to
  politics, Team Y owns the Main section but not really because of external
  reasons. And lastly it is completely unclear who owns the Top Nav because
  everyone contributes to it but no one team is it's owner.
</p>

import { AssignedPageLayout } from './PageLayouts';

<p className="sr-only">
  In a single-spa setup, you could have clear divisions of the applications; and
  therefore clear ownership of specific features in the codebase. These teams
  are enabled to be more autonomous. This image shows the same sections but
  assigned to Red Squad, Gold Squad, and Blue Squad.
</p>

<AssignedPageLayout />

import { ShipsPageLayout } from './PageLayouts';

<p className="sr-only">
  Autonomous teams enable independent code deployments. A team can decide how
  best to develop their feature. single-spa's lifecycles abstract the component
  model so you can use just about any modern framework to develop a
  microfrontend. For example Red Squad can choose an X-wing, the fastest ship
  available but doesn't have a large impact. Gold Squad can make use of a
  Y-wing, a fast ship that is good for everyday missions. And Blue Squad can use
  a B-wing, a slow ship that has a large impact.
</p>

<p className="sr-only">
  Additional shared modules and utilities (Millenium Falcon) can also be helpful
  in fighting the Empire by centralizing shared logic and standardizing on
  libraries so teams can move more quickly.

    Once you understand the monolith, you can begin plans to break it up into
    applications, utility modules, and shared dependencies. This architecture
    will also require changes to engineering culture and development workflows.
    All of those are tradeoffs to using microfrontends.
