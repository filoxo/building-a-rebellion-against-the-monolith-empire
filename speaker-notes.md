- want to start off with this tweet

---

- microfrontends are microservices
- better to call them "microservices in the browser"

---

- independent deployments are how teams are autonomous
- migration
  - how many of you have worked somewhere with old code that just never seems to die? EVERYONE
  - there is an end in sight
  - is NOT just about using multiple frameworks
- there is future to be had
- how many of you have experienced

---

- Origin story: Canopy
- Small team who wanted to overthrow the status quo of their AngularJS app
- builds upon the emerging "Component pattern"

---

- single-spa was born

---

- The framework has a concept of "rendering", placing the component for the first time
- and then mount and unmount
- a frontend router simply listens to changes in the URL, and appropriately mounts and unmounts

- You can swap this out for Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc

---

- Now take that one step higher
- single-spa lifecycles abstract the "component model" to the FRAMEWORK level
- now are called "applications"

---

- In practice... It can take you from this
- Team X definitely owns this area
- Team Y owns this area but not really because
  - tech debt
  - org changes
  - politics

---

- Clear boundaries
- Clear ownership
- All the benefits of microservices

---

- Team autonomy
- they drive the right ship based on features
- APPEAR - and supporting services to enable teams to do what they need to

---

- we are here
- we know and understand our monolith

---

- Soon, all teams will be involved in breaking up the monolith

---

- I'll share these slides with these resources
